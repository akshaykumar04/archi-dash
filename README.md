## Description
ArchitectUI is built using the latest web development technologies and features more than 250 components, elements and widgets perfectly integrated with each other and always powered by Bootstrap.

It features a modular frontend architecture making it easy to exclude the components that you’re not going to use in your app.

It’s ES6 ready, powered by Webpack, which is responsible for compressing and concatenating the asset resources.

All the stylesheets are built entirely using SCSS & variables, which makes things a lot easier if you want to customise the colour schemes, components or layouts.

You can easily create your own dashboard pages or choose from one of the 9 already available. Also, there are 10 different colour schemes available, each with it’s own SCSS variables stylesheet.

Developer License grants access to the private ArchitectUI Github repository so that you’ll never miss a bugfix or new release.
